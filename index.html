        <div class="subheading mb-5">undeclared</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm an undergraduate student at UCR, although my major is still undeclared, I do have a lot of experience in business and video editing.Growing up I always aided my parents with help, since they owned their own business. They owned a part supply business, so I would help my mom answer the work calls and schedule reservations. I believe doing this at a young age really improved my communication skills, which is very good in any job. This enabled me to build good people skills, which will allow me to have good relationships with clients/ job peers. As I got older I started working as an auditor. This job required me to examine financial accounts of the business, and constantly examine the company accounts. Doing all this gave me experience in the work field and helped me obtain good soft skills<br><br>

        Soft skills that I have are patience, problem solving and leadership. I also ran a draping business with my sister which involved a lot of problem solving and creativity.In highschool I joined a class called link crew which focused on mentoring freshmen and aiding them into their transition from middle school to high school.This taught me how to be a leader and take charge, therefore i believe I have a lot to offer in any job, and am able to solve any problem I encounter and take charge. Another soft skill that I have acquired was being patient. I have a lot of younger siblings, and along with mentoring freshman It has allowed me to be more patient and listen more which is a quality that is really important.<br><br>

        I am also a very dependable person, and will put in all my effort into what I am doing. I am always open to learning more, which is why I am looking for new jobs in order to explore new skills. My job as an auditor will help me work in businesses, so I will have an advantage and provide great service since I already have a lot of experience in that era of the industry. I can be an introvert, although when I need to I am able to be personable and social which I believe is a good trait to have. Both in the workplace, in different positions, different skills are needed but having both is a great benefit. I am hoping to work in a place that pays a good wage such as $20 an hour, and is close to where I live. As I mentioned before I am most interested in working in a place that deals with business, and retail. I am a full time student, therefore I am only looking for a part time job, with flexible hours and that can be done online since it would be more beneficial to me.
